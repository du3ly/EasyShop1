                Introducing the perfect shirt for the perfect suit. Featuring a trim, tailored fit, this shirt was specifically created by our design team with the proportions of the Ludlow suit in mind. 
                Crafted in two-ply 120s cotton?a fine weave with natural lustre and a luxurious handfeel?it's finished with bespoke-inspired touches like a split back yoke (a made-to-measure detail that ensures a clean drape) 
                and darts at both shoulders for a streamlined silhouette.
