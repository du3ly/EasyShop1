                Our ST cut is a slim fit with a taper from the thigh to the knee, ending with a small leg opening. The ST-220x jean features our 14.5 oz. selvedge Double Black denim, which consists of black warp and weft threads. This denim is custom woven exclusively for 3sixteen by Kuroki Mills in Okayama, Japan. While the fabric is quite resistant to fade at first, with hard wear the black will eventually fade to grey in high wear areas.
